            <h4>Origin</h4>
            <p>
             I was taught the ways of the bow and survival by the austere order of the Boy Scouts of America learning the ways of shooting and burning shit and how to survive in the deep wilderness of our national parks across the nation. Fifteen years ago I was initiated into the ancient art of yoga by my uncle Fidel, wherein I was able to obtain achieve super human feats of bendy yoga moves and clarity of mind transcending human understanding.  <br>
              Today I spend my time continuing to fight injustice through shooting inanimate stuff, meditating and contorting myself in fun ways.  I also failed to mention that I am apart of the ancient order of the BarMitzvah. I continue to teach young kids in the chanting arts in the mystical language known as Hebrew, as they prepare to enter the austere and noble order of the BarMitzvah, so they too can get up in front of their proud moms,families and friends wow them with their awesome Hebrew chanting powers.  You are likely to find me out in the woods with my trusty bow and with my faithful side-kick,Tucker the Pitbull as we romp through the woods and wilderness of Utah and shoot arrows into random crap, nothing living of course because that would just be douchey. If you have a second, check out my instagram @marko5744 to behold all the awesomeness and cute pics of my pup.
